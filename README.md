## About Me

I am a Systems Engineering student at Atlas School with more than eleven years of technical experience across Microsoft, Apple, and AT&T. My background includes troubleshooting Windows and macOS systems, device imaging, networking fundamentals, software and hardware support, and delivering clear, customer-focused solutions. I am particularly interested in roles that combine hands-on technical support with opportunities to grow into systems, automation, and security-focused work.

I enjoy building practical tools that solve real problems, whether that is an automation script, a custom Discord/Twitch bot, or a small web application. I value reliability, clear communication, and environments where learning is continuous and encouraged.
